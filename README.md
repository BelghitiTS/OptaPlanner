**Optical Optimal** is a GUI based application that provides the functionality to backup directories onto several discs or USB flash drives. The objective is to store as many directories as possible into a single discs or USB flash drive with the following criteria.

1. Nothing is compressed such that a restore is required to view a file
2. No directory is split onto two drives

See the <a href='/optical-optimal/Readme.md'>Readme</a> file for the optical-optimal project for more detail.
