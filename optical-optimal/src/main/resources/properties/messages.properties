intro-title=[Optical Optimal] :: Optical Driver Optimization
intro-text=The Optical Driver Optimization lets you figure out the maximum number of \
folders you can copy into an optical drive, whether CD, DVD, or BluRay.  Point to the \
root directory that contains as many sub-directories and I will figure out how many \
writable drives you need and which sub-directories should be stored together.
userinput-title=User Input
userinput-text=Enter the number of discs you will like to use and the size of each disc.  \
If you do not have a limit in the number of disc then leave it blank or set to '0'.

disc-type-bluray=Blu-Ray

disc-num-of-discs=Number of Discs:
disc-type=Disc Type
select-disc-type=Select the Disc Type
size-disc=Size of Each Disc (Bytes):

info-title=Select a Root Folder
info-text=Now, you will be asked to select a root folder.  This folder should contain \
files and directories that you want to write to the optical discs.  If this root folder \
contains file, it will be picked up to be written to your drive.  If this root folder \
contains directories, then the directory will be used as one entry.  It will not be broken \
down.  This way, we can guarantee that a directory is stored in a single disc and not broken \
into several discs.

not-feasible=Given the number of discs and the total amount of data, we cannot find a \
solution.  This is because you do not have enough discs to hold all of the files and folders \
or discs with high capacity given the size of your folders.

pane-title=Disc {0} Total Size {1} bytes [{2}] [{3}]
top-label-1=You provided {0} discs each with a size of {1} bytes.
top-label-2=The solution found optimized with using {0} discs.
