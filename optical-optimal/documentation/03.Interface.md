## Select Disc

The next page asks for the type of media, optical drives.  The `Number of Discs` is the total number of discs you have to save all of your directories.  If you leave this blank, then it will default to 100 discs.

```
Number of Discs:
```

Next, define the  `Size of Each Disc (Bytes)`.  You may have a 25G BluRay, but depending on the tool that you use to write these files and directories to the disc, you may not be able to use all of the space.  This provides an additional control over the exact size that you can use to write these directories.

## Select a Root Folder

Select a folder that contains all of the directories and files that you want to move to your discs.  The application will calculate the sizes of each directory by traversing  all of the sub-directories and will determine the best combination of files to store into the discs given the size of the disc and the size of the directories and files.  This result will be the optimal solution that uses as much of the capacity of the disc as possible.

## Result

The final page will display a list of media and the files that should be written to each of them so that you have the most optimal combination of files and directories per media.
