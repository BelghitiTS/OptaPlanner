**<h1 align='center'>Optical Optimal :: Optical Driver Optimization</h1>**

Optical Optimal is a GUI based application that provides the functionality to backup directories onto several discs or USB flash drives.  The objective is to store as many directories as possible into a single discs or USB flash drive with the following criteria.

1. Nothing is compressed such that a restore is required to view a file
2. No directory is split onto two drives
